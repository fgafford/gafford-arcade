Things that need to be added:

- make 2 player
	- make shot blue
	- make pl2 ship red
- time based difficutly
    - make it so that number of meteors increase with time
    ? make it so that they move faster with time?
        - maybe their should just be fast waves or something
- place a timer on in the middle of the top screen
- have power ups fall from top (not inside of rocks)
- make a $ or points power up
- powerup changes
    - make gun powerup #1 change the rate of fire
    - make gun powerup #2 do spread fire maybe???
    - make powerups fall faster
- mob/meteor changes
    - make larger meteors break into 2 (or 3) smaller ones when shot
    ? make some grey meteors cannot be shot/destroyed?
- make an extra life bonus at so many points
- red hot exploding meteors
- split meteor on explosion (like astroids game)
	- give them the same speed
	- random downword direction

Bugs: 
- player is able to shoot after explosion before new ship appears



===== What do we want from this game... =====
- For difficulty:
   - number of meteors to increase with time
   ? speed of meteors to increase with time? 
        - maybe the possible top speed could increase with time
        - maybe we do a difficulty multiplier
            - it will change as the game changes
