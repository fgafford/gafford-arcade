Things that need to be added:

+ place a timer on in the middle of the top screen
- time based difficutly
    - make it so that number of meteors increase with time
    ? make it so that meteors move faster with time?
        - maybe their should just be fast waves or something

- powerup changes
    + 1: single shot (slow)
    + 2: duel cannon (slow)
    + 3: rapid fire (fast)
    - make a powerup obtained sound
    - Missiles
        + gained like a regular power-up
        + make a falling missle sprite (no fire)
	- make a missle sprint with fire
	BUG: bullets and missles are the same in the game currently
		- cannot fire a missle at the same time as a lazer
        - always destroy and entire meteor when missile strikes
	- get a different missle sound
	- make a cooler missile explosion sound

- mob/meteor changes
    ? make some grey meteors cannot be shot/destroyed?
    ? red hot exploding meteors
    - split meteor on explosion (like astroids game)
        ? 2 or 3 smaller pieces???
        - give them the same speed
        - random downword direction
    - grey meteors!!!
        - can only be destroyed by missiles 
        - has gem(s) inside that fall out when destroyed
        - gems follow same meteor tragectory
- gems: 
    - how to make sprite: 
        https://onimille.tumblr.com/tutorials
    - MUST get Jael in on the design here!
    - maybe make then green, blue, or light blue
- make 2 player
    - have both players get power-up on touch
    - make seperate controls for each ship....
- make an extra life bonus at so many points
- summary screen

Bugs: 
- player is able to shoot after explosion before new ship appears




===== What do we want from this game... =====
- For difficulty:
   - number of meteors to increase with time
   ? speed of meteors to increase with time? 
        - maybe the possible top speed could increase with time
        - maybe we do a difficulty multiplier
            - it will change as the game changes
