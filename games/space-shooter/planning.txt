=== To plan ===
- How do we decided on meteor frequency?

- How do we decided on powerup frequency?
    - think this is good as a percent
        - the more things you shoot the more chance you have to get power-ups
            > may want to make the shield power-up stronger

- How do we do scoring?
    - really comes down to getting gems

    - things that make it fun  
        - powerups 
        - having to move fast

== Scoring ==
Meteor: 25
Black detroyed: 200 
Gem: 1k
Extra Life: 8k / 10k
